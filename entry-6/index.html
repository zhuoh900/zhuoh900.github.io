  <h2>Entry: 1980s — Pop Culture & Futurism</h2>

  <h3>Why the DeLorean DMC-12 is a Classic</h3>
  <p>
    The DeLorean DMC-12 is considered a classic not just for its engineering, but for its lasting cultural impact.
    Its brushed stainless-steel body and distinctive gull-wing doors gave it a futuristic, timeless appearance.
    Although its production was brief (1981–1983) and the company faced commercial struggles, the car became an icon
    after starring as a time machine in the <em>Back to the Future</em> trilogy. The DeLorean represents the intersection
    of innovative design, pop culture, and storytelling—a vehicle whose legend has far outlived its mechanical reality.
