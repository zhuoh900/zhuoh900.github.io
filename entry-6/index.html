  <h1>Why the DeLorean DMC-12 is a Classic</h1>
  <h2>The DeLorean DMC-12 is considered a classic not just for its engineering, but for its lasting cultural impact. Its brushed stainless-steel body and distinctive gull-wing doors gave it a futuristic, timeless appearance. Although its production was brief (1981–1983) and the company faced commercial struggles, the car became an icon after starring as a time machine in the Back to the Future trilogy. The DeLorean represents the intersection of innovative design, pop culture, and storytelling—a vehicle whose legend has far outlived its mechanical reality.</h2>
