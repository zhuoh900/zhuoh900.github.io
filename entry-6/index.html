      <p>
        Released in the early 1980s, the DeLorean DMC-12 is best known for its stainless-steel body and gull-wing doors.
        Although its engineering and commercial life were brief, the car became an enduring cultural icon after starring
        as the time machine in the <em>Back to the Future</em> film trilogy. The DeLorean occupies the space between
        industrial design, myth, and nostalgia — a vehicle that turned into a symbol of imagined futures.
