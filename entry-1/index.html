  <h2>First Car in the World</h2>

 <img src="benz-patent-motorwagen.png">


  <p>The first true automobile is widely considered to be the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, 
  built by Karl Benz in 1885 and patented in 1886. It was powered by a single-cylinder 
  four-stroke engine, producing about 0.75 hp, and had three wheels.</p>

  <p>This small, hand-built vehicle marked the birth of the modern car. It combined a 
  gasoline engine, transmission, and chassis in one self-propelled unit — a radical 
  innovation for its time.</p>

  <p>The Motorwagen is celebrated as the first practical car designed for everyday use, 
  and it laid the foundation for the automotive industry.</p>
