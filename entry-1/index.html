    <p>The first true automobile is widely considered to be the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, built by Karl Benz in 1885 and patented in 1886. It was powered by a single-cylinder four-stroke engine, producing about 0.75 hp, and had three wheels.</p>
    <p>This small, hand-built vehicle marked the birth of the modern car. It combined a gasoline engine, transmission, and chassis in one self-propelled unit — a radical innovation for its time.</p>
    <p>The Motorwagen is celebrated as the first practical car designed for everyday use, and it laid the foundation for the automotive industry.</p>
