  <h2>BMW M3 E46 </h2>

  <p>The E46 M3 was produced from 2000–2006 and is often considered the perfect 
  balance of size, power, and analog driving feel.</p>

  <p>It uses the S54 engine — a high-revving 3.2L inline-six with motorsport roots. 
  Naturally aspirated, razor sharp, and one of BMW’s greatest engines.</p>

  <p>The car is known for its balanced chassis, hydraulic steering, and iconic 
  bulged fenders. A driver’s car, pure and mechanical.</p>

  <p>For many enthusiasts, the E46 M3 is the definitive modern M3 — the last one 
  before electronics started taking over.</p>
